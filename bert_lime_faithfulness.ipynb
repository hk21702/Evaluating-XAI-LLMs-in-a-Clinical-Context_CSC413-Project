(Of note, she was unable to get MRI due to \\nreportedly having a non-compatible aneurysm clip that was placed \\nin ___ at ___. Patient was admitted to the ___ for close \\nmonitoring and surgical planning. She was started on dexamethasone 4mg Q6hr for mass effect.

On ___, it was determined \\nthat her aneurysm clip was   compatible and she was able to \\nhave a MRI Brain for surgical planning. She went to the OR the \\nevening of ___ for a suboccipital craniotomy for resection of \\nher cerebellar lesion. Postoperatively she was monitored in \\nNeuro ICU, where she remained neurologically and hemodynamically \\nstable. She was transferred to the ___ on POD#2 and made floor \\nstatus. Her Dexamethasone was ordered to taper down to a \\nmaintenance dose of 2mg BID over the course of one week.
