In terms of chest pain, patient \\nultimately underwent LHC on ___ showing no lesions. She \\ncontinued to have chest pain despite GI cocktail and pain \\nregimen. She was trialed on Isurdil which actually resolved her \\npain. In terms of fluid overload, patient was treated with IV \\ndiuresis and discharged in euvolemic condition. In addition, \\npatient's course was complicated by subtherapeutic INR and \\nconcern for mitral valve thrombus, however, TEE showed no \\nthrombus and she was bridged with heparin to goal INR on \\ndischarge.\\n\\nCORONARIES: ___ clean coronaries/ ___ with clean \\ncoronaries. \\nPUMP: EF 35-40% as of ___\\nRHYTHM: NSR\\n\\n=============== \\nACTIVE ISSUES: \\n=============== \\n#NSTEMI\\n#Atypical Chest pain\\nPatient has a longstanding history of atypical chest pain for \\nwhich she has undergone previous work-up including diagnostic \\nLHC in ___ showing clean coronaries and no obstructive CAD. Her \\n___ stress test revealed a poor exercise tolerance, resting \\nhypertension, and a blunted blood pressure response, as well as \\na decrease in her heart rate (90s to ___ but no ischemic ECG \\nchanges or wall motion abnormalities were appreciated. Her \\ncurrent symptoms are consistent with prior presentations. EKG \\ndoes show similar STD in lateral leads and TWI in V4-V6 which \\nare stable compared to prior EKGs. However, the big difference \\nis that she had significantly elevated troponins on admission \\ntrending up to 0.25 and since downtrending. Initially, this was \\nthought to be possibly a type II MI iso decompensated heart \\nfailure but unusually high\\ntroponins and normal renal function. It was less likely a type I \\nNSTEMI given such clean coronaries on LHC in ___. Now with TTE \\nshowing global hypokinesis, decreased EF to 35-40%. Therefore, \\npatient underwent repeat LHC on ___ given continuing ___ \\nchest pain which again showed no angiographically apparent \\ncoronary artery disease and normal left-side filling pressures. \\nPatient failed GI cocktails and typical pain regimens. \\nTherefore, she was trialed on Isurdil 10mg TID which did relieve \\nher pain. This could represent microvascular changes given her \\nhistory of rheumatic heart disease, however is still atypical. \\nWill discharge on Imdur given its success and tolerance.\\n\\n#Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (35-40%) \\n#Hypoxemia\\nPatient had a most recent EF of 45%, although repeat TTE in \\n___ stress echo showing recovered EF of 60%. Echo this \\nadmission showed EF of 35-40%. CXR showed moderate pulmonary \\nvascular congestion also with BNP ___. Possible trigger was \\ndietary indiscretion given high salt diet. Patient received IV \\ndiuresis. She was not transitioned to a standing oral regimen as \\nshe was improved to baseline euvolemic, not reaccumulating fluid \\noff diuretics. Patient continued on home losartan and \\nmetoprolol. Patient euvolemic and saturating well on room air \\nupon discharge. Weight on discharge 71.9kg.

An ovoid density projects inferior to the fibula \\nmeasures 5 mm, of unclear etiology, potentially sequelae of \\nprior trauma.

Likely the patient's \\nstenosis of her airway from large goiter contributing. Also, may \\nhave undiagnosed COPD given emphysematous changes on her CT scan \\nalong with untreated OSA. Her elevated bicarbonate is suggestive \\nof a chronic process. She was transferred to the ICU on ___ \\nfor monitoring w/continuous O2 (88-92%) due to concerns about \\nairway compression and increasing oxygen requirement shortly \\nafter her admission. ENT was consulted on ___ for evaluation \\nof any airway compromise and did not feel that any intervention \\nwas warranted. She did not demonstrate any respiratory distress \\nat any time during her hospital stay. She was transferred to the \\nfloor on the ___ and had continuous O2 monitoring. She also \\ncontinued to use BiPap with good effect at night. Bipap settings \\nwere: EPAP 5 IPAP 15 O2 flow: 6\\n\\n#LUE DVTs: Patient w/new onset DVTs despite therapeutic \\nwarfarin. This is concerning for a coagulopathy. It is unclear \\nif this is inherited or acquired perhaps in the setting of \\nmalignancy. No clear provoking symptoms. CT abdomen/pelvis was \\nnegative for overt malignancy or metastases. Imaging did show \\npulmonary nodules that will need to be followed up with repeat \\nimaging. Also, there is concern for malignancy related to her \\nmultinodular thyroid. She is scheduled to follow up with her \\nendocrinologist regarding this. She was placed on enoxaparin 80 \\nmg q12hr per hematology recommendations. Hematology/Oncology was \\nfollowing her throughout admission as well.\\n\\n#Gout. Patient had some left foot/ankle pain which impaired her \\nability to walk. It improved after colchicine administration. \\nXRay of left foot was negative. \\n\\n#Atrial Fibrillation: Has chronic atrial fibrillation, and \\nwarfarin was discontinued as she developed upper extremity DVTs \\nwith therapeutic INR. Lovenox was initiated. Amiodarone was at \\nfirst discontinued in the ICU, and then restarted on the floor. \\nShe was discharged on her home dose of 100 daily. Her PR \\ninterval was >200 and she was not considered a good candidate \\nfor a beta blocker while in house.\\n\\n#Coronary Artery Disease: Stable. Continued atorvastatin, \\naspirin\\n\\n#Hypertension: Stable. Continued home amlodipine, lisinopril\\n\\n#Thyroid disease:Patient w/large goiter, and questionable effect \\non trachea. Followed by ___ endocrinology. IP and ENT at ___ \\nwill consider intervention pending whether there is malignancy \\nwithin goiter, and overall patient prognosis. Methimazole was \\ncontinued. Thyroglobulin pending at discharge.  Abd/pelvic CT \\nwithout evidence of malignancy.\\n\\n#MGUS: monoclonal IgG kappa represents only 1% of total protein. \\nThe rest of it, and IgA, are polyclonal. Free kappa and lambda \\nlight chains both slightly elevated, not worrisome for myeloma. \\nNo further evaluation needed. \\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\\n#She was followed by hem/onc atrius as inpatient: PCP can refer \\nher to Dr ___, ___ Heme, for further follow-up if deemed \\nappropriate.\\n\\n# For the PCP: IP can offer her a joint procedure with ENT \\nregarding her large multinodular goiter and its impingement on \\nthe trachea when it is clear whether there is malignancy present \\nor not, and what the overall prognosis of patient is. They can \\ncertainly stent her trachea if it starts to compromise her \\nairway if that is within the patient goals of care. An \\nappointment in interventional pulmonology/compromised ___ \\nclinic is being made for her at ___ to follow up this issue.\\n\\n#Multiple pulmonary nodules, the largest of which measures 7 mm. \\nIf clinically indicated, follow-up chest CT is suggested at ___ \\nmonths.

The patient was neurologically intact \\nand hemodynamically stable, but required additional time with \\nvasopressor support.  Chest tubes were removed without problems. \\n He developed symptomatic, rapid atrial fibrillation on POD 2 \\nand converted to sinus rhythm after IV amiodarone and beta \\nblocker was initiated.  After receiving 1uRBC for postop anemia, \\nhe developed flash pulmonary edema and required bipap support.  \\nHe responded will to diuretics and was transitioned to HiFlo \\nnasal cannula and eventual traditional nasal cannula oxygen \\nsupport.  His pacing wires were discontinued without \\ncomplication.  Given his ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), his \\nlisinopril was restarted.  Lisinopril was subsequently \\ndiscontinued due to hypotension.   He was transferred to the \\ntelemetry floor for further recovery.  The patient was evaluated \\nby the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and \\nmobility.
