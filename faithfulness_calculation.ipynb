Hematoma:  The patient developed a large hematoma extending \\nfrom his right flank to his right mid-thigh in the setting of a \\nrecent mechanical fall and initiation of anticoagulation with \\nLovenox and Coumadin with an INR of 3.8 on admission.  His INR \\nwas successfully reversed with vitamin K and FFP in the ED.  His \\nhematocrit fell significantly from a baseline of 46 to 22.8 the \\nAM of ___ and he required 3 units of pRBC transfusion to bring \\nhis hematocrit to around 30 at time of discharge.  No CTA was \\nneeded to rule out extravasation as it appeared that his \\nbleeding stopped after reversal of his INR as evidenced by his \\nappropriate hematocrit response to blood transfusions. He also \\nhad compressive neuropathy from the mass effect of the hematoma \\ncausing limited right lower extremity movement and initial \\nconcern for compartment syndrome.  The mass effect of the \\nhematoma was also likely causing urinary retention which \\nrequired the placement of a Foley catheter.  The urinary \\nretention quickly resolved as the hematoma resorbed and he had a \\nsuccessful trial of void prior to discharge.  Given the lower \\nextremity weakness and urinary retention, spinal cord \\ncompression was ruled out by an MRI on admission.  Orthopedics, \\nvascular, and neurology were all consulted to help manage his \\nacute presentation due to concern for compartment syndrome, \\nconcern for active extravasation and falling hematocrit, and \\nweakness; respectively.  It was determined that the patient did \\nnot have compartment syndrome, so there was no need for surgical \\nintervention.  His physical exam was monitored closely and he \\nnever developed a cold extremity or lost peripheral pulses.  His \\nmotor strength and sensory of his right lower extremity improved \\ndramatically throughout his admission and are documented in the \\nPE section of this document.  With the help of ___, the patient \\nwas able to ambulate with a walker.  An AFO brace was provided \\nfor his right foot given the foot drop he developed as a result \\nof the compressive neuropathy from the hematoma.  Oxycodone was \\nprescribed as needed and worked well for pain control secondary \\nto swelling and compression of his sciatic nerve.  He was \\nadvised not to drive given his new foot drop and use of opiates \\nthat will cause drowsiness. \\n.\\n#. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was diagnosed with new onset \\natrial fibrillation on ___ and was successfully cardioverted.  \\nHe remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry throughout his \\nadmission.  After his last hospitalization for cardioversion, he \\nwas discharged on Lovenox/Coumadin and presented to the ED with \\nan INR of 3.8 and evidence of a large hematoma on exam.  \\nCardiology/EP was consulted in the ED to guide further \\nmanagement and recommended starting amiodarone 200mg TID for 1 \\nweek, 200mg BID for 1 week, and then continue on 200mg daily in \\nan attempt to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the \\nacute period as he is at high risk given the significant amount \\nof stress due to the bleed, pain, and anemia.  It was also \\nagreed that all anticoagulation needed to be discontinued for \\nthe time being as his risk of continued bleeding currently \\noutweighed the preventive stroke benefits of anticoagulation.  \\nFortunately, it was deemed that the left atrial appendage \\nvelocity was vigorous on ECHO and there was no spontaneous ECHO \\ncontrast and no significant aortic thrombus making his risk of \\nstroke reduced, but not non-existent. Unfortunately, he \\ndeveloped a diffuse, pruritic skin rash on his back and chest a \\nfew days after starting amiodarone which was attributed to the \\ndrug.  Therefore, amiodarone was discontinued prior to discharge \\nand no other anti-arrythmics or beta blockers were started.  He \\nwill follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient in ___ clinic. \\n \\n.\\n#. CODE: Full code this admission, but DNR/DNI per last \\ndischarge summary\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\n1.

You had \\nsignificant bleeding into this hematoma and actually lost half \\nof your blood stores.  You required 4 units of blood \\ntransfusions to restore your blood to a safe level.  You also \\nrequired a urinary catheter to drain your bladder until you \\nregained bladder function.  You will be discharged on opiates \\nfor pain control and should not drive or operate heavy machinery \\nwhile on these drugs.  You should not drive until your right \\nsided foot drop improves.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The \\nleft ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe \\nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or \\nthrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging \\nsuggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure \\n(PCWP>18mmHg). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The \\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \\nstenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on \\nthe aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is \\nseen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is \\nseen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive \\nfilling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The \\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate \\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \\neffusion. \\n\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no \\nvegetations are seen.  \\n\\nCT Scan ___\\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized \\nthorax, there \\nis a small left pleural effusion and associated relaxation \\natelectasis. \\nAtelectatic changes are also seen at the right lung base, though \\nsome regions \\nsuggest possibility of aspiration as well. The heart is top \\nnormal in size.  \\nThere are dense coronary artery calcifications. There is no \\npericardial \\neffusion. \\n  \\nThere is a small amount of pneumoperitoneum with the bulk of \\nfree air located \\nanterior to the liver. Locules of gas seen anteriorly throughout \\nthe abdomen \\nand inferiorly to below the pelvis (series 2, image 57). \\n  \\nIn the abdomen, evaluation of the solid organs is limited \\nwithout intravenous \\ncontrast. Linear regions of low density adjacent to calcified \\nhepatic \\narteries, particularly in the left ___ be dilated bile \\nducts. The \\natrophic pancreas, spleen, and adrenals appear normal. Vessels \\nare densely \\ncalcified suggesting diabetes. Both kidneys are again atrophic. \\n  \\nThere is distention of small bowel loops to 2.7 cm (series 300B, \\nimage 10). \\nThere is effacement of fat about the small bowel and thickened \\nwalls in the \\nupper loops of bowel. Small locules of air also seen in the \\nsuperior and \\nanterior central small bowel loops (series 2, image 39). No \\ndefinite \\npneumatosis is seen.  \\n  \\nThere is effactment of fat about large bowel. Bowel wall \\nthickness is \\ndifficult to establish without oral contrast but appears \\nabnormal the \\ndescending colon. There is a locule of gas abutting a portion of \\nhepatic \\nflexure of the colon (series 2, image 39). Fluid is seen \\nadjacent to the \\ndescending colon towards the sigmoid (series 2, image 51; series \\n300B, image \\n22).  \\n  \\nThere is no pathologic abdominal lymphadenopathy. The takeoffs \\nof the celiac \\nand superior mesenteric arteries are densely calcified as are \\nall the \\nintra-abdominal vessels. Given no intravenous contrast was \\nadministered, \\nassessing patency is not possible with this study. \\n  \\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A left femoral \\nvenous central \\nline is seen with tip terminating in the right atrium. The \\nbladder \\ndemonstrates air anteriorly, probably from instrumentation. \\nMultiple calcific \\nround densities within the bulky anteverted uterus suggest \\ndystrophic \\ncalcification within fibroids. Fluid tracks down the paracolic \\ngutters more on \\nthe left than right. Adnexa are unremarkable. There is no pelvic \\n\\nlymphadenopathy. \\n  \\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or \\nosteoblastic lesion. \\nMultilevel degenerative changes are seen in the spine. A small \\numbilical fat- \\ncontaining hernia is seen. \\n  \\nIMPRESSION: \\n  \\n1. Pneumoperitoneum. \\n  \\n2. Abnormal small bowel loops, gas distended, probably will wall \\nthickening \\nand demonstrate fat pericolonic fat effacement. A larger locules \\nof gas is \\nseen abutting a segment of small bowel centrally suggestive of a \\nfocus of \\nperforation. \\n  \\n3. Possible bowel wall thickening involving the colon and \\npericolonic fat \\neffacement involving all large bowel. This may be seen in \\ncolitis \\n(nonspecific). Fluid tracks down the paracolic gutters more on \\nthe left than \\nright. A locule of air abutting a segment of hepatic flexure. \\n  \\n4. Densely calcified aorta and celiac and superior mesenteric \\nartery takeoffs \\nin this context is suspiscious for an ischemic component. \\nHowever, given that \\nno IV contrast was administered, cannot assess vessel patency. \\n  \\n5.

Atrophic kidneys and pancreas. \\n  \\n\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMICU Course:\\n\\nThe patient was admitted to the medical ICU for hypotension and \\nconcern for recurrent bacteremia after dialysis. She did not \\nrequire vasopressor agents, and was treated with vancomycin, on \\nan HD protocol. She was empirically treated for C. diff though \\nresults did not return while she was in the ICU. Echocardiogram \\nshowed no masses or vegetations, though did show her EF was now \\n20%, similar to 25% from most recent other echocardiogram. Renal \\nrecommended starting Florinef after she had an appropriate ___ \\nstim. Her metoprolol was held. \\n\\nDuring an episode of dialysis, she became again hypotensive and \\ndeveloped increased abdominal pain following completion. Serial \\nKUBs became positive for free air, and CT scan of the abdomen \\nconfirmed viscous perforation. She was started on broad spectrum \\nantibiotics, and a surgical consultation was obtained. \\nUnfortunately, given the risk of surgery, it was felt that she \\nwould likely not survive the operation. The surgical risk was \\ndiscussed with the patient, and a plan to pursue comfort \\noriented goal of care was put into place. Palliative care \\nfollowed in consultation.

At the T9 and \\nT10 levels, again seen is abnormal increased signal intensity in \\nthe spinal cord on the long TR images with slight expansion of \\nthe cord. This area enhances faintly after contrast \\nadministration. As discussed previously, the differential \\ndiagnosis includes radiation myelopathy or intramedullary \\nmetastatic disease. The enhancing component of the lesion \\nappears unusually linear for an intramedullary neoplasm, and \\nthis finding would favor radiation myelitis. There have been no \\nchanges since the prior examination. No new areas of enhancement \\nare detected.\\n \\nCONCLUSION: Better demonstration of enhancing focus at T9 and \\nT10 within the spinal cord associated with increased signal on \\nthe long TR images and slight expansion of the cord. The pattern \\nis more suggestive of radiation myelopathy than of metastatic \\ndisease.\\n\\nMR ___ ___ - Again at T10 level, linear increased \\nsignal on T1- and T2-weighted images identified within the cord \\nwith subtle enhancement. The pattern of signal changes is more \\nsuggestive of radiation myelopathy than intramedullary \\nmetastasis as suggested previously, but clinical correlation and \\nfollowup would be helpful. No significant change is seen. Bony \\nmetastatic lesion identified in the thoracic vertebral bodies as \\nbefore. No significant new abnormalities. \\n\\nAdmission labs:\\n\\n___ 02:30PM   ___ PTT-60.1* ___\\n___ 02:10PM   GLUCOSE-142* UREA N-14 CREAT-0.7 SODIUM-139 \\nPOTASSIUM-3.7 CHLORIDE-103 TOTAL CO2-24 ANION GAP-16\\n___ 02:10PM   estGFR-Using this\\n___ 02:10PM   ALT(SGPT)-18 AST(SGOT)-24 ALK PHOS-121* TOT \\nBILI-0.4\\n___ 02:10PM   LIPASE-11\\n___ 02:10PM   WBC-6.8 RBC-3.67* HGB-11.2* HCT-33.9* MCV-92 \\nMCH-30.6 MCHC-33.1 RDW-17.0*\\n___ 02:10PM   NEUTS-80.4* LYMPHS-14.6* MONOS-4.0 EOS-0.7 \\nBASOS-0.4\\n___ 02:10PM   PLT COUNT-177\\n\\nDischarge labs:\\n\\n___ 12:40AM BLOOD WBC-14.3* RBC-3.45* Hgb-10.6* Hct-32.7* \\nMCV-95 MCH-30.8 MCHC-32.5 RDW-16.8* Plt ___\\n___ 12:40AM BLOOD Glucose-280* UreaN-32* Creat-0.8 Na-133 \\nK-3.5 Cl-94* HCO3-25 AnGap-18\\n___ 12:40AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.4 Mg-2.___ F with metastatic cancer admitted with neurogical signs \\nconsistent with spinal cord compression, evidence of T10 \\nintramedullary lesion but no evidence of external metastasis.  \\nMRI from yesterday of ___ was more suggestive of radiation \\nmyelopathy than extrinsic compression.  \\n\\n# Weakness: The patient presented with severe weakness of her \\nLLE, stool and bowel incontinence and numbness in the T10-L2 \\ndermatomes.  On initial whole spine MRI in the emergency room, \\nthere was concern for a possible intramedullary lesion in the \\nspinal cord consistent with this lesion at the T10 level.  \\nConcern for extrinsic compression of the spine by metastatic \\ntumor led to urgent consultation of radiation oncology, \\ninitiation of dexamethasone and 1 session of 400milligray XRT.  \\nHowever, subsequent imaging of the affected area with dedicated \\n___ MRI showed the lesion to be more in line with radiation \\nmyelitis as the patient had previously been irradiated in that \\narea for metastatic disease.  Nevertheless, the patient's \\nneurological exam improved with much improved strength in the \\nlower extremities, but persistent numbness in the aforementioned \\nregions.  The patient remained incontinent throughout her stay.  \\nShe was discharged on 4mg dexamethasone q6h along with bactrim \\nprophylaxis, to be followed up by her outpatient ___ \\n___ oncologist.\\n\\n# Urinary/bowel incontinence: Given radiation myelitis, \\nimprovement of this is unlikely.  Urinary retention was likely, \\nand the patient recieved straight catheterization and will need \\nteaching in rehab for eventual discharge with scheduled \\ncatheterization to empty bladder.  \\n\\n# Hypertension - The patient was hypertensive throughout her \\nstay, which was attributed to the dexamethasone.  Her metoprolol \\n50mg bid was changed to labetolol at the dose of 300 mg BID. She \\nwas also started on chlorthalidone, and her lisinopril was \\nincreased to 40mg daily.  These will likely need to be titrated \\nas blood pressure improves after stabilized on decadron.\\n\\n# Hyperglycemia - the patient also was quite hyperglycemic while \\non the dexamethasone.  She was started on lantus long-acting \\ninsulin, which will need to be titrated down as the \\ndexamethasone is tapered given the patient has no previous \\nhistory of diabetes.\\n\\n# Metastatic breast CA - further treatment deferred to \\noutpatient oncologist.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nVerapamil 240mg SA daily\\nLevoxyl 75mcg daily\\nZoledronic acid 4mg q3months\\nLisinopril 20mg daily\\nLorazepam 1mg qhs\\nMetoprolol 50mg twice daily\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Also possible is syncope ___ \\northostasis given his orthostatic VS here, however less likely \\ngiven the convincing HPI for seizure.  \\n.  \\n# Syncope: DDx is broad, however given the patient's story, I am \\nmost concerned for seizure. Other etiologies are certainly \\npossible, however given the history, I think it is important to \\nevaluate him as a seizure patient. Most notable is his \\northostasis on the floor, and we will have to address that as \\nwell. Other causes of syncope that are easy to r/o and that \\nshould be done are infx, arrhythmia, electrolyte disturbances. \\nThe pt does have a 1st degree AV block, however this is usually \\nnot a malignant process and is not symptomatic. AS is not likely \\nas murmur is not c/w AS, rather MR.  \\n.\\nGiven that we were most concerned with seizure, we did a brain \\nMRI (which did not show any pathology) and a 20 minute EEG \\n(pending at time of discharge, however prelim read without \\nseizure activity).  We also c/s neurology who felt that he did \\nnot need any antiepileptics, but rather can f/u with outpt \\nneurology.\\n.  \\n# Orthostatic VS: Pt seems to be volume down given exam and \\northostatic VS.  We hydrated with IVF and held BP meds.  The \\npt's BP meds were held and we discharged the pt without his BP \\nmedications as his BP has been normotensive here without the \\nlisinopril/HCTZ\\n.  \\n# ARF: Pt's Cr is 1.3 up from a baseline of 1.0. Most likely is \\nprerenal, especially given orthostatic VS. We hydrated. We held \\nlisinopril as well.  Unfortunately, the pt did undergo a \\ngadolinium load during his hospitalization.  Regardless, we feel \\nthis can be f/u as an outpatient with a repeat Chem-7 in one \\nweek's time. We asked the patient to avoid NSAIDs as an \\noutpatient and we continued to hold his lisinopril.\\n.  \\n# HTN: As above, we held the lisinopril/HCTZ, even at time of \\ndischarge as he remained normotensive without antihypertensives. \\n This can be readdressed as an outpatient.\\n  \\n# gout: continued colchicine  \\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nCOLCHICINE 0.6 mg PO daily  \\nLISINOPRIL-HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 20 mg-25 mg Tablet PO daily  \\nACETAMINOPHEN 650 mg Tablet Sustained Release -prn pain  \\nIBUPROFEN [ADVIL] - 200-400 mg prn foot pain  \\n\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1. colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \\n(Daily).  \\n2. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sustained Release Oral\\n\\n \\nDischarge Disposition:\\nHome\\n \\nDischarge Diagnosis:\\nPRIMARY:\\n1. fall, suspected seizure\\n\\n \\nDischarge Condition:\\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\\n\\n \\nDischarge Instructions:\\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you during your \\nhospitalization.\\nYou were admitted to ___ for a fall and a question of \\nseizure-like activity.

Hematoma:  The patient developed a large hematoma extending \\nfrom his right flank to his right mid-thigh in the setting of a \\nrecent mechanical fall and initiation of anticoagulation with \\nLovenox and Coumadin with an INR of 3.8 on admission.  His INR \\nwas successfully reversed with vitamin K and FFP in the ED.  His \\nhematocrit fell significantly from a baseline of 46 to 22.8 the \\nAM of ___ and he required 3 units of pRBC transfusion to bring \\nhis hematocrit to around 30 at time of discharge.  No CTA was \\nneeded to rule out extravasation as it appeared that his \\nbleeding stopped after reversal of his INR as evidenced by his \\nappropriate hematocrit response to blood transfusions. He also \\nhad compressive neuropathy from the mass effect of the hematoma \\ncausing limited right lower extremity movement and initial \\nconcern for compartment syndrome.  The mass effect of the \\nhematoma was also likely causing urinary retention which \\nrequired the placement of a Foley catheter.  The urinary \\nretention quickly resolved as the hematoma resorbed and he had a \\nsuccessful trial of void prior to discharge.  Given the lower \\nextremity weakness and urinary retention, spinal cord \\ncompression was ruled out by an MRI on admission.  Orthopedics, \\nvascular, and neurology were all consulted to help manage his \\nacute presentation due to concern for compartment syndrome, \\nconcern for active extravasation and falling hematocrit, and \\nweakness; respectively.  It was determined that the patient did \\nnot have compartment syndrome, so there was no need for surgical \\nintervention.  His physical exam was monitored closely and he \\nnever developed a cold extremity or lost peripheral pulses.  His \\nmotor strength and sensory of his right lower extremity improved \\ndramatically throughout his admission and are documented in the \\nPE section of this document.  With the help of ___, the patient \\nwas able to ambulate with a walker.  An AFO brace was provided \\nfor his right foot given the foot drop he developed as a result \\nof the compressive neuropathy from the hematoma.  Oxycodone was \\nprescribed as needed and worked well for pain control secondary \\nto swelling and compression of his sciatic nerve.  He was \\nadvised not to drive given his new foot drop and use of opiates \\nthat will cause drowsiness. \\n.\\n#. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was diagnosed with new onset \\natrial fibrillation on ___ and was successfully cardioverted.  \\nHe remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry throughout his \\nadmission.  After his last hospitalization for cardioversion, he \\nwas discharged on Lovenox/Coumadin and presented to the ED with \\nan INR of 3.8 and evidence of a large hematoma on exam.  \\nCardiology/EP was consulted in the ED to guide further \\nmanagement and recommended starting amiodarone 200mg TID for 1 \\nweek, 200mg BID for 1 week, and then continue on 200mg daily in \\nan attempt to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the \\nacute period as he is at high risk given the significant amount \\nof stress due to the bleed, pain, and anemia.  It was also \\nagreed that all anticoagulation needed to be discontinued for \\nthe time being as his risk of continued bleeding currently \\noutweighed the preventive stroke benefits of anticoagulation.  \\nFortunately, it was deemed that the left atrial appendage \\nvelocity was vigorous on ECHO and there was no spontaneous ECHO \\ncontrast and no significant aortic thrombus making his risk of \\nstroke reduced, but not non-existent. Unfortunately, he \\ndeveloped a diffuse, pruritic skin rash on his back and chest a \\nfew days after starting amiodarone which was attributed to the \\ndrug.  Therefore, amiodarone was discontinued prior to discharge \\nand no other anti-arrythmics or beta blockers were started.  He \\nwill follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient in ___ clinic. \\n \\n.\\n#. CODE: Full code this admission, but DNR/DNI per last \\ndischarge summary\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\n1.

You had \\nsignificant bleeding into this hematoma and actually lost half \\nof your blood stores.  You required 4 units of blood \\ntransfusions to restore your blood to a safe level.

You were admitted \\nbecause you had a low potassium level. This was likely due to \\none of your medications, metolazone. The low potassium was the \\nlikely cause of your weakness and muscle cramping prior to being \\nadmitted. You were given potassium through your veins and by \\nmouth, and your metolazone was discontinued. At discharge your \\npotassium level was within normal limits. \\n\\nYour diuretics to treat your cirrhosis were initially held on \\nadmission. Both furosemide and spironolactone were started after \\nwe corrected your potassium. Please continue taking these \\nmedications at home. \\n\\nYour kidney function was slightly abnormal on admission. We \\nbelieve that is because you did not have enough fluid going to \\nthem.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The \\nleft ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe \\nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or \\nthrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging \\nsuggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure \\n(PCWP>18mmHg). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The \\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \\nstenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on \\nthe aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is \\nseen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is \\nseen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive \\nfilling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The \\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate \\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \\neffusion. \\n\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no \\nvegetations are seen.  \\n\\nCT Scan ___\\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized \\nthorax, there \\nis a small left pleural effusion and associated relaxation \\natelectasis. \\nAtelectatic changes are also seen at the right lung base, though \\nsome regions \\nsuggest possibility of aspiration as well. The heart is top \\nnormal in size.  \\nThere are dense coronary artery calcifications. There is no \\npericardial \\neffusion. \\n  \\nThere is a small amount of pneumoperitoneum with the bulk of \\nfree air located \\nanterior to the liver. Locules of gas seen anteriorly throughout \\nthe abdomen \\nand inferiorly to below the pelvis (series 2, image 57). \\n  \\nIn the abdomen, evaluation of the solid organs is limited \\nwithout intravenous \\ncontrast. Linear regions of low density adjacent to calcified \\nhepatic \\narteries, particularly in the left ___ be dilated bile \\nducts. The \\natrophic pancreas, spleen, and adrenals appear normal. Vessels \\nare densely \\ncalcified suggesting diabetes. Both kidneys are again atrophic. \\n  \\nThere is distention of small bowel loops to 2.7 cm (series 300B, \\nimage 10). \\nThere is effacement of fat about the small bowel and thickened \\nwalls in the \\nupper loops of bowel. Small locules of air also seen in the \\nsuperior and \\nanterior central small bowel loops (series 2, image 39). No \\ndefinite \\npneumatosis is seen.  \\n  \\nThere is effactment of fat about large bowel. Bowel wall \\nthickness is \\ndifficult to establish without oral contrast but appears \\nabnormal the \\ndescending colon. There is a locule of gas abutting a portion of \\nhepatic \\nflexure of the colon (series 2, image 39). Fluid is seen \\nadjacent to the \\ndescending colon towards the sigmoid (series 2, image 51; series \\n300B, image \\n22).  \\n  \\nThere is no pathologic abdominal lymphadenopathy. The takeoffs \\nof the celiac \\nand superior mesenteric arteries are densely calcified as are \\nall the \\nintra-abdominal vessels. Given no intravenous contrast was \\nadministered, \\nassessing patency is not possible with this study. \\n  \\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A left femoral \\nvenous central \\nline is seen with tip terminating in the right atrium. The \\nbladder \\ndemonstrates air anteriorly, probably from instrumentation. \\nMultiple calcific \\nround densities within the bulky anteverted uterus suggest \\ndystrophic \\ncalcification within fibroids. Fluid tracks down the paracolic \\ngutters more on \\nthe left than right. Adnexa are unremarkable. There is no pelvic \\n\\nlymphadenopathy. \\n  \\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or \\nosteoblastic lesion. \\nMultilevel degenerative changes are seen in the spine. A small \\numbilical fat- \\ncontaining hernia is seen. \\n  \\nIMPRESSION: \\n  \\n1. Pneumoperitoneum. \\n  \\n2. Abnormal small bowel loops, gas distended, probably will wall \\nthickening \\nand demonstrate fat pericolonic fat effacement.

Atrophic kidneys and pancreas. \\n  \\n\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMICU Course:\\n\\nThe patient was admitted to the medical ICU for hypotension and \\nconcern for recurrent bacteremia after dialysis. She did not \\nrequire vasopressor agents, and was treated with vancomycin, on \\nan HD protocol. She was empirically treated for C. diff though \\nresults did not return while she was in the ICU. Echocardiogram \\nshowed no masses or vegetations, though did show her EF was now \\n20%, similar to 25% from most recent other echocardiogram. Renal \\nrecommended starting Florinef after she had an appropriate ___ \\nstim. Her metoprolol was held. \\n\\nDuring an episode of dialysis, she became again hypotensive and \\ndeveloped increased abdominal pain following completion. Serial \\nKUBs became positive for free air, and CT scan of the abdomen \\nconfirmed viscous perforation. She was started on broad spectrum \\nantibiotics, and a surgical consultation was obtained. \\nUnfortunately, given the risk of surgery, it was felt that she \\nwould likely not survive the operation. The surgical risk was \\ndiscussed with the patient, and a plan to pursue comfort \\noriented goal of care was put into place. Palliative care \\nfollowed in consultation. She was continued on antibiotics, and \\nalso on norepinephrine that had been started the evening of the \\nct findings.

At the T9 and \\nT10 levels, again seen is abnormal increased signal intensity in \\nthe spinal cord on the long TR images with slight expansion of \\nthe cord. This area enhances faintly after contrast \\nadministration. As discussed previously, the differential \\ndiagnosis includes radiation myelopathy or intramedullary \\nmetastatic disease. The enhancing component of the lesion \\nappears unusually linear for an intramedullary neoplasm, and \\nthis finding would favor radiation myelitis. There have been no \\nchanges since the prior examination. No new areas of enhancement \\nare detected.\\n \\nCONCLUSION: Better demonstration of enhancing focus at T9 and \\nT10 within the spinal cord associated with increased signal on \\nthe long TR images and   expansion of the cord. The pattern \\n  more suggestive of radiation myelopathy than of metastatic \\ndisease.\\n\\nMR ___ ___ - Again at T10 level, linear increased \\nsignal on T1- and T2-weighted images identified within the cord \\nwith subtle enhancement. The pattern of signal changes is more suggestive of radiation myelopathy than intramedullary \\nmetastasis as suggested previously but clinical correlation and \\nfollowup would be helpful. No significant change is seen. Bony \\nmetastatic lesion identified in the thoracic vertebral bodies as \\nbefore.

On initial whole spine MRI in the emergency room, \\nthere was concern for a possible intramedullary lesion in the \\nspinal cord consistent with this lesion at the T10 level.  \\nConcern for extrinsic compression of the spine by metastatic \\ntumor led to urgent consultation of radiation oncology, \\ninitiation of dexamethasone and 1 session of 400milligray XRT.  \\nHowever, subsequent imaging of the affected area with dedicated \\n___ MRI showed the lesion to be more in line with radiation \\nmyelitis as the patient had previously been irradiated in that \\narea for metastatic disease.  Nevertheless, the patient's \\nneurological exam improved with much improved strength in the \\nlower extremities, but persistent numbness in the aforementioned \\nregions.  The patient remained incontinent throughout her stay.  \\nShe was discharged on 4mg dexamethasone q6h along with bactrim \\nprophylaxis, to be followed up by her outpatient ___ \\n___ oncologist.\\n\\n# Urinary/bowel incontinence: Given radiation myelitis, \\nimprovement of this is unlikely.  Urinary retention was likely, \\nand the patient recieved straight catheterization and will need \\nteaching in rehab for eventual discharge with scheduled \\ncatheterization to empty bladder.  \\n\\n# Hypertension - The patient was hypertensive throughout her \\nstay, which was attributed to the dexamethasone.  Her metoprolol \\n50mg bid was changed to labetolol at the dose of 300 mg BID. She \\nwas also started on chlorthalidone, and her lisinopril was \\nincreased to 40mg daily.  These will likely need to be titrated \\nas blood pressure improves after stabilized on decadron.\\n\\n# Hyperglycemia - the patient also was quite hyperglycemic while \\non the dexamethasone.  She was started on lantus long-acting \\ninsulin, which will need to be titrated down as the \\ndexamethasone is tapered given the patient has no previous \\nhistory of diabetes.\\n\\n# Metastatic breast CA - further treatment deferred to \\noutpatient oncologist.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nVerapamil 240mg SA daily\\nLevoxyl 75mcg daily\\nZoledronic acid 4mg q3months\\nLisinopril 20mg daily\\nLorazepam 1mg qhs\\nMetoprolol 50mg twice daily\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

His symptoms were \\nlikely related to mild acute diastolic heart failure. He will be \\ndischarged on home dose of lasix given creatinine bump while \\ninpatient.  \\n.\\n# Renal insufficiency: Cr was 2.1 on admission. Fe urea 47%, \\nsuggestive of intrinsic renal process.  Latest Cr from ___ \\nvisit in early ___ was also 2.1. No microalbuminuria indicating \\ndiabetic nephropathy, likely ___ to chronic uncontrolled HTN.  \\nCr bumped to 2.4 on ___, likely due to increased lasix dosing \\nand resuming of lisinopril on ___ for HTN control. Lasix and \\nlisinopril held for 1 day and resumed on day of discharge with \\nCr 2.3. Pt with difficult to control HTN and responds very well \\nto lisinopril and lasix. Thus, they were continued on admission \\ndoses. He will have a repeat Cr at his PCP\\'s office ___.\\n.\\n# HTN: Pt with SBP in the 220 range when holding lasix and \\nlisinopril. This was treated effectively with hydralazine and \\namlodipine. Pt was started on amlodipine and this was increased \\nto 10mg daily. In addition, metoprolol dosing was decreased \\nsecondary to bradycardia. Despite adding amlodipine, with SBP \\n160\\'s (also likely secondary to decreased metoprolol dosing) and \\ntherefore lasix and lisinopril were added back with good effect. \\nPts BP is much better controlled on these medications. He will \\nfollow up with his PCP this week for further titration if \\nneeded.\\n.\\n# Bradycardia: Patient\\'s HR consistently stayed in the ___, \\nlikely ___ to metoprolol and possibly tizanidine. Pt\\'s \\nmetoprolol was decreased to 25mg BID. \\n.\\n#urinary retention-Likely related to pt\\'s prior history of \\nurinary strictures. Pt with urinary retention in the ED and \\nfoley catheter was placed, but with some difficulty. Therefore, \\nhe was discharged with the foley in place. He will follow up \\nwith urology this week for voiding trial.\\n.\\n# Hyperkalemia: K 5.2 on admission.  Likely ___ to ACEI and/or \\nchronic renal insufficiency.  No findings on EKG.

As per the director, the pt was in the \\nkitchen drinking a cup of coffee, chatting   other residents \\nwhen all of sudden his right arm started shaking rhythmically He started spilling coffee all  , and the shaking spread to \\nthe rest of his body. All four limbs were shaking and the \\npatient fell into the   and slumped down on the floor. He \\ndid not hit his head on   way down. The shaking lasted approximately 1:15 minutes, and the director states there was no \\nevidence of urinary or bowel incontinence.

Also possible is syncope ___ \\northostasis given his orthostatic VS here, however less likely \\ngiven the convincing HPI for seizure.  \\n.  \\n# Syncope: DDx is broad, however given the patient's story, I am \\nmost concerned for seizure. Other etiologies are certainly \\npossible, however given the history, I think it is important to \\nevaluate him as a seizure patient. Most notable is his \\northostasis on the floor, and we will have to address that as \\nwell. Other causes of syncope that are easy to r/o and that \\nshould be done are infx, arrhythmia, electrolyte disturbances. \\nThe pt does have a 1st degree AV block, however this is usually \\nnot a malignant process and is not symptomatic. AS is not likely \\nas murmur is not c/w AS, rather MR.  \\n.\\nGiven that we were most concerned with seizure, we did a brain \\nMRI (which did not show any pathology) and a 20 minute EEG \\n(pending at time of discharge, however prelim read without \\nseizure activity).  We also c/s neurology who felt that he did \\nnot need any antiepileptics, but rather can f/u with outpt \\nneurology.\\n.  \\n# Orthostatic VS: Pt seems to be volume down given exam and \\northostatic VS.  We hydrated with IVF and held BP meds.  The \\npt's BP meds were held and we discharged the pt without his BP \\nmedications as his BP has been normotensive here without the \\nlisinopril/HCTZ\\n.  \\n# ARF: Pt's Cr is 1.3 up from a baseline of 1.0. Most likely is \\nprerenal, especially given orthostatic VS. We hydrated. We held \\nlisinopril as well.  Unfortunately, the pt did undergo a \\ngadolinium load during his hospitalization.  Regardless, we feel \\nthis can be f/u as an outpatient with a repeat Chem-7 in one \\nweek's time. We asked the patient to avoid NSAIDs as an \\noutpatient and we continued to hold his lisinopril.\\n.  \\n# HTN: As above, we held the lisinopril/HCTZ, even at time of \\ndischarge as he remained normotensive without antihypertensives. \\n This can be readdressed as an outpatient.\\n  \\n# gout: continued colchicine  \\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nCOLCHICINE 0.6 mg PO daily  \\nLISINOPRIL-HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 20 mg-25 mg Tablet PO daily  \\nACETAMINOPHEN 650 mg Tablet Sustained Release -prn pain  \\nIBUPROFEN [ADVIL] - 200-400 mg prn foot pain  \\n\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1. colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \\n(Daily).  \\n2. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sustained Release Oral\\n\\n \\nDischarge Disposition:\\nHome\\n \\nDischarge Diagnosis:\\nPRIMARY:\\n1. fall, suspected seizure\\n\\n \\nDischarge Condition:\\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\\n\\n \\nDischarge Instructions:\\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you during your \\nhospitalization.\\nYou were admitted to ___ for a fall and a question of \\nseizure-like activity.

Hematoma:  The patient developed a large hematoma extending \\nfrom his right flank to his right mid-thigh in the setting of a \\nrecent mechanical fall and initiation of anticoagulation with \\nLovenox and Coumadin with an INR of 3.8 on admission.  His INR \\nwas successfully reversed with vitamin K and FFP in the ED.  His \\nhematocrit fell significantly from a baseline of 46 to 22.8 the \\nAM of ___ and he required 3 units of pRBC transfusion to bring \\nhis hematocrit to around 30 at time of discharge.  No CTA was \\nneeded to rule out extravasation as it appeared that his \\nbleeding stopped after reversal of his INR as evidenced by his \\nappropriate hematocrit response to blood transfusions. He also \\nhad compressive neuropathy from the mass effect of the hematoma \\ncausing limited right lower extremity movement and initial \\nconcern for compartment syndrome.  The mass effect of the \\nhematoma was also likely causing urinary retention which \\nrequired the placement of a Foley catheter.  The urinary \\nretention quickly resolved as the hematoma resorbed and he had a \\nsuccessful trial of void prior to discharge.  Given the lower \\nextremity weakness and urinary retention, spinal cord \\ncompression was ruled out by an MRI on admission.  Orthopedics, \\nvascular, and neurology were all consulted to help manage his \\nacute presentation due to concern for compartment syndrome, \\nconcern for active extravasation and falling hematocrit, and \\nweakness; respectively.  It was determined that the patient did \\nnot have compartment syndrome, so there was no need for surgical \\nintervention.  His physical exam was monitored closely and he \\nnever developed a cold extremity or lost peripheral pulses.  His \\nmotor strength and sensory of his right lower extremity improved \\ndramatically throughout his admission and are documented in the \\nPE section of this document.  With the help of ___, the patient \\nwas able to ambulate with a walker.  An AFO brace was provided \\nfor his right foot given the foot drop he developed as a result \\nof the compressive neuropathy from the hematoma.  Oxycodone was \\nprescribed as needed and worked well for pain control secondary \\nto swelling and compression of his sciatic nerve.  He was \\nadvised not to drive given his new foot drop and use of opiates \\nthat will cause drowsiness. \\n.\\n#. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was diagnosed with new onset \\natrial fibrillation on ___ and was successfully cardioverted.  \\nHe remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry throughout his \\nadmission.  After his last hospitalization for cardioversion, he \\nwas discharged on Lovenox/Coumadin and presented to the ED with \\nan INR of 3.8 and evidence of a large hematoma on exam.  \\nCardiology/EP was consulted in the ED to guide further \\nmanagement and recommended starting amiodarone 200mg TID for 1 \\nweek, 200mg BID for 1 week, and then continue on 200mg daily in \\nan attempt to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the \\nacute period as he is at high risk given the significant amount \\nof stress due to the bleed, pain, and anemia.  It was also \\nagreed that all anticoagulation needed to be discontinued for \\nthe time being as his risk of continued bleeding currently \\noutweighed the preventive stroke benefits of anticoagulation.  \\nFortunately, it was deemed that the left atrial appendage \\nvelocity was vigorous on ECHO and there was no spontaneous ECHO \\ncontrast and no significant aortic thrombus making his risk of \\nstroke reduced, but not non-existent. Unfortunately, he \\ndeveloped a diffuse, pruritic skin rash on his back and chest a \\nfew days after starting amiodarone which was attributed to the \\ndrug.  Therefore, amiodarone was discontinued prior to discharge \\nand no other anti-arrythmics or beta blockers were started.  He \\nwill follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient in ___ clinic. \\n \\n.\\n#. CODE: Full code this admission, but DNR/DNI per last \\ndischarge summary\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\n1.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The \\nleft ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe \\nglobal left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or \\nthrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging \\nsuggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure \\n(PCWP>18mmHg). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The \\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic \\nstenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on \\nthe aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is \\nseen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is \\nseen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive \\nfilling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The \\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate \\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial \\neffusion. \\n\\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no \\nvegetations are seen.  \\n\\nCT Scan ___\\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized \\nthorax, there \\nis a small left pleural effusion and associated relaxation \\natelectasis. \\nAtelectatic changes are also seen at the right lung base, though \\nsome regions \\nsuggest possibility of aspiration as well. The heart is top \\nnormal in size.  \\nThere are dense coronary artery calcifications. There is no \\npericardial \\neffusion. \\n  \\nThere is a small amount of pneumoperitoneum with the bulk of \\nfree air located \\nanterior to the liver. Locules of gas seen anteriorly throughout \\nthe abdomen \\nand inferiorly to below the pelvis (series 2, image 57). \\n  \\nIn the abdomen, evaluation of the solid organs is limited \\nwithout intravenous \\ncontrast. Linear regions of low density adjacent to calcified \\nhepatic \\narteries, particularly in the left ___ be dilated bile \\nducts. The \\natrophic pancreas, spleen, and adrenals appear normal. Vessels \\nare densely \\ncalcified suggesting diabetes. Both kidneys are again atrophic. \\n  \\nThere is distention of small bowel loops to 2.7 cm (series 300B, \\nimage 10). \\nThere is effacement of fat about the small bowel and thickened \\nwalls in the \\nupper loops of bowel. Small locules of air also seen in the \\nsuperior and \\nanterior central small bowel loops (series 2, image 39). No \\ndefinite \\npneumatosis is seen.  \\n  \\nThere is effactment of fat about large bowel. Bowel wall \\nthickness is \\ndifficult to establish without oral contrast but appears \\nabnormal the \\ndescending colon. There is a locule of gas abutting a portion of \\nhepatic \\nflexure of the colon (series 2, image 39). Fluid is seen \\nadjacent to the \\ndescending colon towards the sigmoid (series 2, image 51; series \\n300B, image \\n22).  \\n  \\nThere is no pathologic abdominal lymphadenopathy. The takeoffs \\nof the celiac \\nand superior mesenteric arteries are densely calcified as are \\nall the \\nintra-abdominal vessels. Given no intravenous contrast was \\nadministered, \\nassessing patency is not possible with this study. \\n  \\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A left femoral \\nvenous central \\nline is seen with tip terminating in the right atrium. The \\nbladder \\ndemonstrates air anteriorly, probably from instrumentation. \\nMultiple calcific \\nround densities within the bulky anteverted uterus suggest \\ndystrophic \\ncalcification within fibroids. Fluid tracks down the paracolic \\ngutters more on \\nthe left than right. Adnexa are unremarkable. There is no pelvic \\n\\nlymphadenopathy. \\n  \\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or \\nosteoblastic lesion. \\nMultilevel degenerative changes are seen in the spine. A small \\numbilical fat- \\ncontaining hernia is seen. \\n  \\nIMPRESSION: \\n  \\n1. Pneumoperitoneum. \\n  \\n2. Abnormal small bowel loops, gas distended, probably will wall \\nthickening \\nand demonstrate fat pericolonic fat effacement. A larger locules \\nof gas is \\nseen abutting a segment of small bowel centrally suggestive of a \\nfocus of \\nperforation. \\n  \\n3. Possible bowel wall thickening involving the colon and \\npericolonic fat \\neffacement involving all large bowel. This may be seen in \\ncolitis \\n(nonspecific). Fluid tracks down the paracolic gutters more on \\nthe left than \\nright. A locule of air abutting a segment of hepatic flexure. \\n  \\n4. Densely calcified aorta and celiac and superior mesenteric \\nartery takeoffs \\nin this context is suspiscious for an ischemic component. \\nHowever, given that \\nno IV contrast was administered, cannot assess vessel patency. \\n  \\n5. Left pleural effusion and associated relaxation atelectasis. \\n  \\n6. Dense vascular calcifications. \\n  \\n7. Small fat-containing umbilical hernia. \\n  \\n8. Atrophic kidneys and pancreas. \\n  \\n\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMICU Course:\\n\\nThe patient was admitted to the medical ICU for hypotension and \\nconcern for recurrent bacteremia after dialysis. She did not \\nrequire vasopressor agents, and was treated with vancomycin, on \\nan HD protocol. She was empirically treated for C. diff though \\nresults did not return while she was in the ICU. Echocardiogram \\nshowed no masses or vegetations, though did show her EF was now \\n20%, similar to 25% from most recent other echocardiogram. Renal \\nrecommended starting Florinef after she had an appropriate ___ \\nstim. Her metoprolol was held. \\n\\nDuring an episode of dialysis, she became again hypotensive and \\ndeveloped increased abdominal pain following completion. Serial \\nKUBs became positive for free air, and CT scan of the abdomen \\nconfirmed viscous perforation. She was started on broad spectrum \\nantibiotics, and a surgical consultation was obtained. \\nUnfortunately, given the risk of surgery, it was felt that she \\nwould likely not survive the operation. The surgical risk was \\ndiscussed with the patient, and a plan to pursue comfort \\noriented goal of care was put into place. Palliative care \\nfollowed in consultation. She was continued on antibiotics, and \\nalso on norepinephrine that had been started the evening of the \\nct findings.

At the T9 and \\nT10 levels, again seen is abnormal increased signal intensity in \\nthe spinal cord on the long TR images with slight expansion of \\nthe cord. This area enhances faintly after contrast \\nadministration. As discussed previously, the differential \\ndiagnosis includes radiation myelopathy or intramedullary \\nmetastatic disease. The enhancing component of the lesion \\nappears unusually linear for an intramedullary neoplasm, and \\nthis finding would favor radiation myelitis. There have been no \\nchanges since the prior examination. No new areas of enhancement \\nare detected.\\n \\nCONCLUSION: Better demonstration of enhancing focus at T9 and \\nT10 within the spinal cord associated with increased signal on \\nthe long TR images and   expansion of the cord. The pattern \\n  more suggestive of radiation myelopathy than of metastatic \\ndisease.\\n\\nMR ___ ___ - Again at T10 level, linear increased \\nsignal on T1- and T2-weighted images identified within the cord \\nwith subtle enhancement.

On initial whole spine MRI in the emergency room, \\nthere was concern for a possible intramedullary lesion in the \\nspinal cord consistent with this lesion at the T10 level.  \\nConcern for extrinsic compression of the spine by metastatic \\ntumor led to urgent consultation of radiation oncology, \\ninitiation of dexamethasone and 1 session of 400milligray XRT.  \\nHowever, subsequent imaging of the affected area with dedicated \\n___ MRI showed the lesion to be more in line with radiation \\nmyelitis as the patient had previously been irradiated in that \\narea for metastatic disease.  Nevertheless, the patient's \\nneurological exam improved with much improved strength in the \\nlower extremities, but persistent numbness in the aforementioned \\nregions.  The patient remained incontinent throughout her stay.  \\nShe was discharged on 4mg dexamethasone q6h along with bactrim \\nprophylaxis, to be followed up by her outpatient ___ \\n___ oncologist.\\n\\n# Urinary/bowel incontinence: Given radiation myelitis, \\nimprovement of this is unlikely.  Urinary retention was likely, \\nand the patient recieved straight catheterization and will need \\nteaching in rehab for eventual discharge with scheduled \\ncatheterization to empty bladder.  \\n\\n# Hypertension - The patient was hypertensive throughout her \\nstay, which was attributed to the dexamethasone.  Her metoprolol \\n50mg bid was changed to labetolol at the dose of 300 mg BID. She \\nwas also started on chlorthalidone, and her lisinopril was \\nincreased to 40mg daily.  These will likely need to be titrated \\nas blood pressure improves after stabilized on decadron.\\n\\n# Hyperglycemia - the patient also was quite hyperglycemic while \\non the dexamethasone.  She was started on lantus long-acting \\ninsulin, which will need to be titrated down as the \\ndexamethasone is tapered given the patient has no previous \\nhistory of diabetes.\\n\\n# Metastatic breast CA - further treatment deferred to \\noutpatient oncologist.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nVerapamil 240mg SA daily\\nLevoxyl 75mcg daily\\nZoledronic acid 4mg q3months\\nLisinopril 20mg daily\\nLorazepam 1mg qhs\\nMetoprolol 50mg twice daily\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

His ECG was unchanged and initial cardiac \\nenzymes were negative. Cardiology was consulted and his cardiac \\nenzymes were cycled. He did rule in for MI. Troponins peaked at \\n0.8. He remained on telemetry and continued his beta blocker, \\nplavix, aspirin, statin. His most recent cardiac cath films were \\nsent over and cardiac surgery was consulted for redo CABG. Per \\ncardiac surgery, he is not a surgical candidate as he does not \\nhave targets. Cardiology felt that he did not have any PCI \\noptions as well and recommended medical management. We titrated \\nhis isosorbide from 20 to 40mg TID with resolution of his chest \\npain. On the day of discharge, he was ambulating independently \\nand walked up the stairs with physical therapy without anginal \\nsymptoms. \\n\\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary \\ntoilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were \\nencouraged throughout hospitalization.\\n\\nGI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids. \\nDiet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated. \\n\\nGU: Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV \\nfluid was adjusted when necessary. \\n\\nFEN: Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when \\nnecessary.\\n\\nID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were \\nclosely watched for signs of infection.

Also possible is syncope ___ \\northostasis given his orthostatic VS here, however less likely \\ngiven the convincing HPI for seizure.  \\n.  \\n# Syncope: DDx is broad, however given the patient's story, I am \\nmost concerned for seizure. Other etiologies are certainly \\npossible, however given the history, I think it is important to \\nevaluate him as a seizure patient. Most notable is his \\northostasis on the floor, and we will have to address that as \\nwell. Other causes of syncope that are easy to r/o and that \\nshould be done are infx, arrhythmia, electrolyte disturbances. \\nThe pt does have a 1st degree AV block, however this is usually \\nnot a malignant process and is not symptomatic. AS is not likely \\nas murmur is not c/w AS, rather MR.  \\n.\\nGiven that we were most concerned with seizure, we did a brain \\nMRI (which did not show any pathology) and a 20 minute EEG \\n(pending at time of discharge, however prelim read without \\nseizure activity).  We also c/s neurology who felt that he did \\nnot need any antiepileptics, but rather can f/u with outpt \\nneurology.\\n.  \\n# Orthostatic VS: Pt seems to be volume down given exam and \\northostatic VS.  We hydrated with IVF and held BP meds.  The \\npt's BP meds were held and we discharged the pt without his BP \\nmedications as his BP has been normotensive here without the \\nlisinopril/HCTZ\\n.  \\n# ARF: Pt's Cr is 1.3 up from a baseline of 1.0. Most likely is \\nprerenal, especially given orthostatic VS. We hydrated. We held \\nlisinopril as well.  Unfortunately, the pt did undergo a \\ngadolinium load during his hospitalization.  Regardless, we feel \\nthis can be f/u as an outpatient with a repeat Chem-7 in one \\nweek's time. We asked the patient to avoid NSAIDs as an \\noutpatient and we continued to hold his lisinopril.\\n.  \\n# HTN: As above, we held the lisinopril/HCTZ, even at time of \\ndischarge as he remained normotensive without antihypertensives. \\n This can be readdressed as an outpatient.\\n  \\n# gout: continued colchicine  \\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nCOLCHICINE 0.6 mg PO daily  \\nLISINOPRIL-HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 20 mg-25 mg Tablet PO daily  \\nACETAMINOPHEN 650 mg Tablet Sustained Release -prn pain  \\nIBUPROFEN [ADVIL] - 200-400 mg prn foot pain  \\n\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1. colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \\n(Daily).  \\n2. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sustained Release Oral\\n\\n \\nDischarge Disposition:\\nHome\\n \\nDischarge Diagnosis:\\nPRIMARY:\\n1. fall, suspected seizure\\n\\n \\nDischarge Condition:\\nMental Status: Confused - sometimes.\\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\\n\\n \\nDischarge Instructions:\\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you during your \\nhospitalization.\\nYou were admitted to ___ for a fall and a question of \\nseizure-like activity.

The right heart border is not well visualized suggesting \\na right middle lobe location. However, given the deformity of \\nthe underlying right tenth rib and the density of the lesion, \\nthis may reflect a chest wall lesion and Chest CT is recommended \\nfor further evaluation. \\n\\nCT chest: 1. 6.1 x 3.2 x 4.5   mass in the right lower lobe, \\nwhich exerts mass effect upon basal segment bronchi with resultant volume loss. Findings are concerning for lung cancer. \\n2. Additional nodules in the right middle lobe. \\n3. Incompletely characterized nodule in the right adrenal gland, \\nbut statistically likely an adenoma Attention on followup is \\nadvised. \\n4. Severe centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. \\n5. Compression deformity of the L1 vertebral body of unclear \\nchronicity. \\n\\nCT abdomen/pelvis with contrast: \\n1. 11 mm right adrenal gland nodule statistically likely to \\nrepresent an adenoma, but in the setting of a lung mass, \\nmetastatic disease cannot be excluded.  Recommend evaluation \\nwith non-contrast CT scan. \\n2. 4.5 cm intra-luminal eccentric lesion in the right colon. \\nThis is not fully evaluated on this single phase scan but is \\nconcerning for colon cancer. Recommend evaluation with a \\nnon-contrast abdominal CT scan to assess. \\n\\nCT abdomen/pelvis without contrast: \\n1. Right colon mass seen on prior examination is enhancing and \\nis highly suspicious for colon cancer. \\n2. There is an 11 mm right adrenal adenoma. \\n\\nNon-contrast head CT: \\n1. No evidence of acute large territorial infarct or hemorrhage. \\n\\n2. Age-related involutional changes and sequela of chronic small \\nvessel \\nischemic disease. \\n3. Sinus disease, as described above. \\n\\nMRI head:\\n1. No acute intracranial abnormality without evidence of stroke \\nor mass. \\n2. Confluent periventricular and subcortical white matter FLAIR \\nsignal hyperintensity with background diffuse cortical volume \\nloss, likely representing sequela of chronic microangiopathy. \\n3. Sinus disease. \\n\\nCXR:\\nThe previously described masslike opacity since ___ has \\nsignificantly improved, with residual heterogeneous opacity, \\nsuggesting focal infection or atelectasis over malignancy. There \\nis new mild opacity in the right middle lobe, which could also \\nrepresent worsening pneumonia in the appropriate clinical \\nsetting. \\n\\nLabs:\\n___ 06:10AM BLOOD WBC-9.5 RBC-3.46* Hgb-12.0* Hct-37.0* \\nMCV-107* MCH-34.7* MCHC-32.4 RDW-13.6 RDWSD-53.6* Plt ___\\n___ 06:10AM BLOOD Neuts-70.1 Lymphs-16.2* Monos-9.3 Eos-3.2 \\nBaso-0.4 Im ___ AbsNeut-6.66* AbsLymp-1.54 AbsMono-0.88* \\nAbsEos-0.30 AbsBaso-0.04\\n___ 06:10AM BLOOD Glucose-85 UreaN-22* Creat-1.2 Na-143 \\nK-4.3 Cl-113* HCO3-18* AnGap-16\\n___ 06:05AM BLOOD VitB12-506\\n___ 05:15AM BLOOD %HbA1c-5.2 eAG-103\\n___ 05:15AM BLOOD Triglyc-79 HDL-47 CHOL/HD-2.8 LDLcalc-67\\n___ 05:15AM BLOOD TSH-2.0\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMr. ___ is a ___ man with prior R MCA stroke, dementia, and \\nschizoaffective disorder who was admitted for altered mental \\nstatus with blank staring and drooling that lasted for 1hr and \\nalso R sided weakness.
