On ___, it was determined \\nthat her aneurysm clip was MRI compatible and she was able to \\nhave a MRI Brain for surgical planning. She went to the OR the \\nevening of ___ for a suboccipital craniotomy for resection of \\nher cerebellar lesion. Postoperatively she was monitored in \\nNeuro ICU, where she remained neurologically and hemodynamically \\nstable. She was transferred to the ___ on POD#2 and made floor \\nstatus.

You \\nshould avoid contact sports for 6 months. \\n\\nMedications:\\n\\n- Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, \\nIbuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. \\nWe held your Aspirin 81mg daily. You are cleared to resume this \\nmedication on POD 14 (___). \\n\\n- We held your home Alendronate during this admission.
